This project aims to create a smart, user-friendly medical recommendation system powered by machine learning, designed to assist users in identifying potential health issues based on their symptoms. By entering one or more symptoms, users receive accurate disease predictions generated by a trained ML model. Alongside the diagnosis, the system offers personalized advice, including suggested medications (when appropriate) and preventative measures to help users make informed decisions about their health. The goal is to provide accessible, reliable health insights to support early awareness and encourage proactive care.
